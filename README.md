# Maryo
## A proxy server used for accessing Pretendo, the open-source Nintendo Network replacement.
## *(Also known as the terminal app your grandma can use!)*

## About
Maryo is a proxy program intended to be as easy as possible to use. The user interface comes first, then the features. if I were to focus more on the features, I could end up with a program that works, but then I'd have a bunch of people asking me how to use it.

## Instructions

### Using precompiled binaries

Go to the releases tab, and download the correct binary for your system. Just double-click it and follow the instructions (*It's that easy!*)

### Building from source ~~(WARNING: EXTREMELY HARDCORE)~~

#### Prerequisites

- [golang](https://golang.org/)
- [goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy)
- [ansicolor](https://github.com/shiena/ansicolor)
- [go-asyncserver](https://github.com/hectane/go-asyncserver)

#### Building

1. Clone this repository
2. It's easy, just `go build` in the source directory
3. You can then double click your own binaries instead of ours (I don't care)
